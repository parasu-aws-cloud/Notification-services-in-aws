#### What is Amazon Simple Queue Service?

*  Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components. Amazon SQS offers common constructs such as dead-letter queues and cost allocation tags. It provides a generic web services API that you can access using any programming language that the AWS SDK supports.

* Benefits of using Amazon SQS:
  
  1. Security – You control who can send messages to and receive messages from an Amazon SQS queue. You can choose to transmit sensitive data by protecting the contents of messages in queues by using default Amazon SQS managed server-side encryption (SSE), or by using custom SSE keys managed in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

  2. Durability – For the safety of your messages, Amazon SQS stores them on multiple servers. Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery, and FIFO queues support exactly-once message processing and high-throughput mode.

  3. Availability – Amazon SQS uses redundant infrastructure to provide highly-concurrent access to messages and high availability for producing and consuming messages.

  4. Availability – Amazon SQS uses redundant infrastructure to provide highly-concurrent access to messages and high availability for producing and consuming messages.

  5. Reliability – Amazon SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time.

  6. Customization – Your queues don't have to be exactly alike—for example, you can set a default delay on a queue. You can store the contents of messages larger than 256 KB using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon DynamoDB, with Amazon SQS holding a pointer to the Amazon S3 object, or you can split a large message into smaller messages.
